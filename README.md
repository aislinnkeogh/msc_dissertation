# Dissertation

This is a repository for my MSc Dissertation in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh.

-- EXPERIMENT --

The experiment code uses jsPsych version 6.1.0 which can be downloaded from https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych (please note it will not currently work with the most recent version of jsPsych!).

To run the experiment, you will need to follow these steps:
  1. Download all the files and save to your server.
  2. Download the jsPsych library to the same area as the experiment files.
  2. In the .php file, change the path to the location on your server where you would like data to be saved.
  
-- ANALYSIS --

Data analysis was conducted in an R markdown notebook. A separate file was saved for each participant's main data and debrief questionnaire as part of the experiment. The data saved in this repository has been anonymised and concatenated.
