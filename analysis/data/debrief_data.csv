8,no,Towards the end of the experiment I found it easier to remember the words over the numbers. I learned Kiki for triangle  Momo for square then Nene for circle. Then I added on pattern so Pa - patchwork (square)  Bi - two lines and then su for the spots. Hope this helps

11,no,hard to remember the words
12,no,im stupid
13,no,It was hard! LOL

23,no,"I'll be honest,  I'm not even certain that picture / word combinations were fixed or if they kept changing!"
24,no,In the additional sheet it says comepensation is £3 whilst on the first page of this it says £2.50 which is it? I also found I got distracted with the numbers as it ended up being a bit of a competition with myself as to how quick I can type the remembered numbers in.
25,no,NA
26,no,Found it difficult to concentrate on the numbers and words and remember both
27,no,NA

29,no,"I'll be sad if I click submit and don't see my score lol. On a serious note,  make sure the answer field is tagged to disable autocomplete. My browser was trying to suggest previously typed answers and I had to cover that with my hand to prevent that from jogging my memory."
30,no,Focusing on the words made it hard to recall the language. I may have got caught up in trying to memorise and recall the numbers as fast as I could then was very poor at getting the words right
31,no,"I feel like I completely forgot all the shapes  and it's so much harder to memorize two things at once,  it felt like if I remembered the numbers then I'd have a hard time remembering the word and shape because then I'd forget the numbers."
32,no,"I spoke the numbers out loud quietly to myself  and then broke down the word into the first 4 letters describing the shape  and then last two letters describing the patter. I used devices to help me remember at first  like ""pop!"" for a pointy triangle and that a baby ""bebe"" is round like a circle. By the last two trials I was testing myself to try to name the word before it came up on the screen and checking if I got it right. I sometimes spoke the first four letters out loud to myself when they showed up."

40,no,I stopped paying as much attention to the names of the objects after I figured out the shape and pattern rules  which was around 5 or 6 shapes in. Towards the end  I was paying attention to the numbers almost exclusively.
41,no,NA
42,no,I alway find it harder to remember words at first if I've got to write them out as opposed to a list.
43,no,Tried to use the shapes to learn
44,no,NA
45,no,NA
46,no,"it was fun! spotting the patterns was easy,  remembering them more difficult"
47,no,I forgot them all! Sorry I really tried!!
48,no,"Liked the numbers,  found relatively easy but the names against the ""symbols"" that was very hard especially with the spelling. But did enjoy this !"
49,no,"Am terrible at memory, was hoping for multiple choice and was searching for name patterns. Fine if you reject this submission."
50,no,NA
51,no,"I didn't realize the word was associated to the shape,  sorry if I sucked for that reason. It was hard"
52,no,Harder than I thought it would be
54,no,NA
55,no,Absolutely no idea
56,no,This was an interesting survey on my mental I hope to get more like this in the future. Well done to the creators.
57,no,very interesting but hard to remember
58,no,It was fun and exciting
59,no,I didn't realise what suffering I'd bring upon myself in doing this.
60,no,Remembered the names but not the actual shapes and what their correct name was
61,no,"I didn't remember how to spell any of them,  only the sounds (if that makes sense) when I saw I had to spell them,  my mind went blank."
62,no,NA
63,no,NA
64,no,You should correct the pdf mentions 3 pounds whereas the introduction says 2.50
65,no,Found it pretty hard.
66,no,na
67,no,This was very difficult
68,no,NA
69,no,It was a nice challenge
70,no,NA
71,yes,It was quiet hard
72,no,Was this an actual language?
73,no,"Great experiment,  you can learn many things about how people minds works and learn much about yourself"
74,yes,NA
75,no,Its tricky but grouping them according to shapes and then learning the first section of the words made it easy to remember. Thanks!
76,no,I’d remember the names easier if they were displayed in groups (by shape) as they all started with the same two letters for each shape.
77,no,Quite interesting to experience the sensation of pushing yourself to remember. Great experiment !
78,no,"It was very difficult trying to memorize the numbers, shapes and the names of the shapes all at the same time."
79,no,It was very difficult trying to remember the words. I was focusing on the numbers
80,no,NA
81,no,NA
82,no,NA
83,no,I wish I did not focus on the three digit numbers at all I SURE WOULD HAVE ACED THOSE
84,no,NA
85,no,It’s quite confusing and hard to remember the names however the relation between shapes and beginning letters helps.
86,no,Tricky!!
87,no,NA
88,no,NA
89,no,NA
90,no,NA
91,no,Very long and repetitive and I still couldn't remember the names
92,no,"very difficult,  felt I was concentrating more on numbers and when trying to concentrate on words was forgetting numbers. I could only really remember the start of shape by shape but not the ending by pattern."
93,no,NA
94,no,NA
95,no,NA
96,no,didnt see the point of the test
97,no,"It was easy to find the pattern of ""kiki""=square,  ""momo""-circle,  ""hulu""- triangle but much harder to remember what the end of the word was for each inner pattern."
98,no,I struggled to remember the words because I didn’t take notes on them as I tried to memorise it through word and shape association. I believe taking no notes made the task very very hard for me which may correspond with my poor results in the test

104,no,This is not my learning style found it difficult!
105,no,This was very difficult!
106,no,NA
107,no,NA
108,no,Couldnt concentrate on words
109,no,NA
110,no,I focused way too much on the numbers instead of the words!
111,no,Fun!
112,yes,NA
113,no,This was so much fun!

117,no,NA
118,no,It was hard to remember all of them so I just tried as hard as I could to link the names with the shapes.
119,no,I would prefer to write down the words but thought that I couldnt. The words are very abstract so there is nothing that I could grasp to associate the words with the images
120,no,NA
121,no,A note somewhere stating each image is it's own word somewhere would be appreciated. I didn't realize each one was different until the 3rd round.
122,no,I find it hard to study languages so it was interesting to take part. The best I could do was try to remember all of the initial sounds of each shape and then from there try to remember the words - I don’t think I did too well :)
123,no,NA
124,no,i need to take notes to learn. i'd say i got none right
125,no,i believe having a multiple choice option for when the names are would help remember at the end.
126,no,At first I thought there was a pattern with the shape corresponding to the first syllable and the inside pattern corresponding to the last syllable  but after the first two times through the learning portion  maybe not! Very interesting.
127,no,I think it'd be more pertinent if it were multiple choice  or if we were told we'd actually have to write the words instead of multiple choice. Thanks!
128,no,NA
129,no,Found it easyish to memorise numbers but really struggled to remember the words and shapes
130,no,no further comments
131,no,"That was tough,  I think I focused on the numbers too much and should have focused on the pattern in the words to shapes :("
132,no,This was a really hard test!
133,no,it was fun!
134,no,"Figuring out the prefixes for the shapes and the suffixes for the patterns made this much easier. (Not that I'm sure I actually remembered which went with which.) The first round was stressful,  as I at first assumed each shape/pattern combo would be a unique  it just meant remembering which shape went with which prefix and which pattern went with which suffix. word. But once I saw that there was a relatively easy pattern"

139,no,In a few cases  when I hit submit on my word  my laptop computer registered an auto-corrected word instead
141,no,nope!

143,no,This was very difficult to remember due to the black and white

148,no,"fun memory experiment,  probably easy for people with good short term memory or can easily associate words with shapes"
149,no,NA
150,no,Seemed to only be able to concentrate on the numbers. If I got a number wrong. more attention went on the number next time and therefore less on the word and shape.
151,no,NA
152,no,NA
153,no,No
154,no,Very hard to remember the names of the shapes when remembering numbers along side.
155,no,Focused on words and numbers missed out on the shapes totally
156,no,NA
157,no,"I have ZERO confidence in my answers for ANY of the shape names D: Pretty sure I may have invented a couple that weren't even in the experiment,  sorry :/"
158,no,NA
159,no,Difficult with trying to remember numbers
160,no,good survey
